# Moving from Self-Registration to SSO?

If IT resources are unavailable your school has barriers that don’t allow for SSO configuration at initial launch, there is the option to move to SSO at a later date.

## What to know

- With the self-registration tool, learners can register using any email address (e.g. school email, gmail, yahoo, etc.).
- There’s a chance of learners including a typo when self-registering.

## Reviewing data

- Initially, we’ll want to audit the number of learners registered to date. See Manage Learners tab.
- Inventory how many learners used an official college email account to register.
- Inventory how many learners used a non-college email (gmail, yahoo) or potentially a different version of the college email address.

## Options for moving to SSO

### Option 1: Fresh start for all learners

- We could work with your school to essentially free up the existing email addresses.
- The school would configure SSO for all learners using the college email address.
- All learners would have a fresh start.
- All previous progress would be attached to the unused accounts.

### Option 2: Fresh start for non-college email addresses

- You can choose to configure SSO using official school college addresses.
- Any learner who registered with the correct college email would have their progress saved.
- Any learner with a non-college email or (any typo or variation of the email) would have a new account created.
- Any learner with a new account created would lose previous progress and data would essentially start over.

### Option 3: Continue progress for all learners

- You can also choose to reconcile all existing accounts so all learners can continue with their current progress.
- This requires the client to download a list of learners from the system, and then identify the correct college email address for all learners. Many times this can be done with first and last name, or if you chose to collect student Id at initial launch.
- IE would update all email addresses to match the college emails provided by the client.
- You could then configure SSO using those college emails.
